  summary: 'Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source  libraries.  A large part of
    Boost is provided as C++ template code which is resolved entirely at compile-time
    without linking.  This  package aims to provide the most useful subset of Boost
    libraries  for template use among CRAN package. By placing these libraries in  this
    package, we offer a more efficient distribution system for CRAN  as replication
    of this code in the sources of other packages is  avoided. '
