  summary: R and Armadillo integration using Rcpp Armadillo is a templated C++ linear algebra
    library (by Conrad Sanderson) that aims towards a good balance between speed and
    ease of use. Integer, floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well
    as a subset of trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions
    are provided through optional integration with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries. The RcppArmadillo
    package includes the header files from the templated Armadillo library. Thus users
    do not need to install Armadillo itself in order to use RcppArmadillo. Armadillo
    is licensed under the MPL 2.0, while RcppArmadillo (the Rcpp bindings/bridge to
    Armadillo) is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the rest of Rcpp.
